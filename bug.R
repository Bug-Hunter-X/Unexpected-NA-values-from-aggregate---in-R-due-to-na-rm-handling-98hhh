```R
# Example data
data <- data.frame(x = c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5), y = c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10))

# Incorrect use of na.rm = TRUE in aggregate
result <- aggregate(y ~ x, data = data, FUN = function(z) {mean(z, na.rm = TRUE)}) 

# Problem:  na.rm = TRUE inside the aggregate function might not be working as expected, particularly if you are applying a function other than mean() which does not intrinsically handle NA values.
#   If any group has all NAs, the aggregate function can still produce NA.

print(result)
```
