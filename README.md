# Unexpected NA values from aggregate() in R
This repository demonstrates a subtle issue related to using `na.rm = TRUE` within the `aggregate()` function in R.  The problem arises when applying a custom function to groups containing only NA values.  While `na.rm = TRUE` works correctly with functions like `mean()`, it may not yield the intended behavior with functions that don't explicitly handle NA values. This leads to unexpected NA outputs even when `na.rm = TRUE` is used. The solution demonstrates how to handle NAs properly before aggregation or using alternative approaches that better handle NAs in different aggregation scenarios.  The example showcases the correct implementation to avoid the issue.
